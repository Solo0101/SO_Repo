# VISUALISATION (ESP)

ESP works when opponents are in the spotlight (the mechanics of the game are such that the appearance of a model of enemy equipment and its display on the client's screen is controlled by the server, which receives data from the player's camera from the client: coordinates, viewing angle, direction of view, and the like. The server makes calculations, based on the results of which it determines whether the player can see a particular model of equipment)

 Vehicle name / Display the name of the technique
